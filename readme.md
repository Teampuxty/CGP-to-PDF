**CGP-Rip**

This tool is for downloading your **owned** CGP online books, into a PDF format.

This is in a BETA phase, and there will probably be bugs.


**Usage**

Download latest release ZIP (not from the source code button), and extract it.

Then, run the CGP to PDF.exe

To download a pdf, you will need a couple of things.

The bookID
  - Found within the url of the book.
    E.G For OCR Computer Science GCSE, the URL is "https://library.cgpbooks.co.uk/digitalaccess/COS43DF/Online/"
    This means the bookID is "COS43DF"
Your Session ID
  - Found within the Dev Console.
    Ctrl (cmd on mac) + Shift + I, then to the Application Tab, then click on cookies, and copy the value of "ASP.NET_SessionId"
Number of pages to download
  - Usually the total number of pages in the book. Used to be able to auto detect this, but CGP has reworked their whole systems.
UNI - Unique identifier for the svg text files.
  - Found within the Dev Console.
    Ctrl (cmd on mac) + Shift + I, then to the Network Tab, then click on any of the pages and copy the uni string at the end of the Request URL (Picture below)
